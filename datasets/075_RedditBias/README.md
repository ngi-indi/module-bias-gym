# 075 RedditBias
is made out of 10,583 annotated
Reddit posts. The dataset consists of four subcategories: Religion, race, gender,
and queerness. It covers diverse topics, such as news, politics, entertainment, and
technology. Out of a collection of more than 1.2 million comments, a representative
subset was chosen and annotated by crowdsourcing. Annotators were given training
examples and required a high accuracy to be included. In the dataset, sentences and
entire phrases were annotated on whether they are biased.
