# 019 Ukraine-News-Corpus
 uses crowdsourcing to annotate 2,094 sentences on three bias dimensions. The three bias dimensions are hidden assumptions and premises, subjectivity, and framing. For the
cognitive bias task, when a majority of annotators agreed upon either dimension,
the sentence is labeled as biased. The sentences stem from 90 different news articles
about the Ukraine crisis being categorized as either being pro-West, pro-Russian, or neutral. Annotations were made by crowd-workers who had to answer test questions
aimed at ensuring the quality of the annotations.
