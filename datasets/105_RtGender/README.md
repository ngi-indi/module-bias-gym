# 105 RtGender
 is a collection of five
datasets with comments from Facebook, Reddit, TED, and Fitocracy to study the
perception of gender. The five datasets contain unlabeled posts from public figures
and their responses, as well as comment response pairs where the gender of the author is known. The authors then labeled a small subset of those five datasets
using crowd-sourcing. The resulting labeled dataset consists of 15,351 manually
annotated posts and responses. For the data collection, only labeled posts and comments were taken and labeled either neutral or biased (if they were annotated with
a "positive" or "negative" gender perception).
