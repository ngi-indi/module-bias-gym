# 072 Liar
contains 12,835 statements with six different labels for the degree of truthfulness of the statements and was specifically designed
to evaluate models for detecting fake news. The statements were scraped from politifacts.com but stem from various sources, from fake news websites to reputable
sources such as The New York Times, and were manually annotated. The dataset
was balanced so that the number of true and false news is similar. For the construction of MBIB, the labels were collapsed to a binary true or false format.
