# 029 SemEval 2019
dataset created for the SemEval 2019 Task 4, which was focused on detecting partisan news. Partisan news is news coverage that is slanted toward a
political ideology. Here, a news article is called partisan if it is either left or right
leaning. If an article is annotated as classified, it is considered politically biased for
the political bias task. The International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) organizes annual tasks to evaluate computational systems doing semantic
analyses. Tasks include, among others, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling,
and, as seen here, partisan news detection.
