# 049 UsVsThem
consists of 6,863
Reddit comments annotated for populist attitudes. Comments were collected based
on being directed towards one of the following groups: "Immigrants, Refugees, Muslims, Jews, Liberals, and Conservatives". Furthermore,
comments needed to be a direct response to a news article. Comments were then
annotated by MTURK crowdworkers on an Us-vs-them scale identifying a recognizable affiliation to or against a group. Such an affiliation is here considered to be a
biased statement. A binary version of the scale is also provided.
Additionally, author also assess the emotions, associated groups
and provide different labels for each comment.
