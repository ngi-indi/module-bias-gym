# 026 Wiki Neutrality Corpus
is  based on Wikipediaâ€™s
POV labels and was. It contains biased
statements as well as their neutral corrections. Opposed to the  `003_WikiNPOV` 
, crowdsourcing annotators did not review the statements. For the MBIB
task, the dataset was split up, and every statement was labeled biased or unbiased
based on its POV-flagged statement or correction.
