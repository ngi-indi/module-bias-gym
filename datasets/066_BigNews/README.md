contains a crawl of articles classified by the media outletâ€™s political leaning as defined by allsites.com. The 3.689.229
articles were classified as neutral or left/right-leaning. The label for left/right was
concatenated to one bias label to binarize it. The articles were split on the sentence
level to make the length compatible with the rest of the data. The resulting data,
however, is only distantly labeled.
