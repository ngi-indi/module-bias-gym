# 106 WorkPlaceSexism
consists of 1,136 sentences labeled with regard to sexism.  This dataset is different from other datasets in that it tries to exclude "hostile sexism," which can
be more often found on social media and less in the workplace where the occurring
sexism is often more subtle. As in news coverage, the present sexism will also likely
be more subtle it is a good fit for a transfer of results toward media bias.
