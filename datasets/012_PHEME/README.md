# 012 Pheme
The Pheme dataset, from the Pheme challenge, provides 5,222 tweets labeled on
the veracity and rumor detection. The Pheme challenge is organized by the Pheme
project (led by the University of Sheffield) and aims to develop models for analyzing
online misinformation. The challenges usually include manually annotated social
media posts, and the participants aim at automatically classifying them as rumors
or checking their veracity. For the usage in the fake news task, only the veracity
of the statements was considered. The extended Pheme version focuses on nine news events. All annotations were done by journalists who
fact-checked all tweets and classified them as false if there was no confirming evidence found.
