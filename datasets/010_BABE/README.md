# 010 BABE

 contains 3,673 manually
annotated news article-based sentences. It was specifically designed for media bias research
and stands out through its thorough annotator training. Annotators were required
to have a substantial background in the media bias domain, underwent specific
training, and were provided with annotation guidelines. BABE provides binary bias
labels and various information on biased words, label opinions, or outlet labels. The
BABE dataset has been used previously to set a benchmark for automated media
bias detection.
