# 035 MediaFrameCorpus
1.5 million news articles from
major English-language news outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, and
Fox News, were collected. 37,622 of these articles were annotated regarding "media
frames". Media frames refer to how a news story or article is framed or presented to
emphasize certain aspects of an issue and downplay or ignore others. Media frames
can be used to shape public opinion and influence policy decisions. The text of each
article was shortened to 225 words by the authors. The annotation process was done
through crowdsourcing. While each article is annotated with multiple frames, these
mainly consist of topic descriptions. The label chosen here as a proxy for mbib task was
whether the author is "Neutral" or "Pro/Anti".
