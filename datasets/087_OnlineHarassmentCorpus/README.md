# 087 Online Harassment Corpus
provides 20,427 tweets
annotated for harassment. For the authors, harassment includes threats, hate
speech, and direct harassment (language meant to violate a certain group or person directly). To collect tweets, the authors searched for tweets based on a set of
terms deemed to be connected to harassment frequently. Every tweet needed to be
annotated by at least two human annotators instructed by an extensive codebook,
including examples.
