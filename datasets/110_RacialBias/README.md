# 110_RacialBias
is a collection of tweets containing racial bias,
which includes tweets from 2018 that have been labeled as containing "racial bias"
or "not racial bias" by human annotators. The dataset contains 751 tweets along
with their labels and additional information on the user, the location, retweets, and
likes. Though it is the only dataset with racially biased tweets publicly available, it
lacks clear documentation and a description in a published research paper.
