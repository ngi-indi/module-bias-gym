# 092 HateXplain
entails 20,148 tweets from Twitter and Gab annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk  for
hate speech as well as offensive language. Annotations include the target of the hate
speech and the text identified in the tweets motivating the label choice. Tweets were
either collected randomly from Twitter based on lexicons or reused from a previous dataset. Before starting the annotation procedure, the
annotators underwent a pilot annotation where they were provided with detailed
guidelines and examples. After the pilot, around one-third of the original annotators were chosen for the primary annotation round. For the hate speech task, only
hate speech and not offensive language was considered.
