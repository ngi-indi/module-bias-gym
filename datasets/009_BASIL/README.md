# 009 BASIL
 contains 1,726 manually annotated biased
spans from 300 articles. The dataset includes articles from various sources, including mainstream and alternative media. The articles were collected over several years
and span a wide range of topics, including politics, health, science, and technology.
Spans were annotated by human annotators trained to detect bias and misinformation in the statements. Annotations were then cross-checked for high inter-annotator
agreement. While the annotations contain more detailed information on the type of
bias and its direction, for this task, only whether a span was annotated as biased
was considered.
