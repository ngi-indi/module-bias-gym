# 076 Contextual Abuse Dataset
the authors collected comments and posts from 116 subreddits. They manually annotated them for various
types of abusive or hateful language and the target of the abusive language. The
collected comments were annotated by crowdsourcing. Annotators were required
to reach a consensus regarding the annotation choice. Annotation conflicts were
therefore discussed among annotators until a consensus was reached. Afterward,
annotations were reviewed by an expert. After missing text entries were dropped,
26,235 were labeled neutral or abusive.
